# Abstract:

This study investigates the impact of government support for research and development (R&D) on the economic growth and innovation performance of the Philippines. Drawing upon academic literature and economic data, the research aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of R&D investments in driving sustainable development in the Philippine region.

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of economic indicators with qualitative examination of policy frameworks and academic research. Using data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and academic databases, the research assesses trends in R&D expenditure, innovation output, and economic growth over a specified time period.

Building upon existing academic works, including studies by David, C. C., & Laurino, R. (2019) and De Dios, E., et al. (2020), the study examines the relationship between government R&D investments and key economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) growth, employment rates, and technological innovation. It also explores the role of policy interventions, such as the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) and the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) roadmap, in shaping the R&D landscape and fostering innovation ecosystems.

Through econometric analysis and case studies of successful R&D initiatives in the Philippines, the research identifies best practices and policy recommendations for enhancing the impact of R&D investments on economic development. The findings of this study are expected to inform policymakers, government agencies, and industry stakeholders on strategies to promote sustainable growth, technological advancement, and innovation-driven competitiveness in the Philippine region.
